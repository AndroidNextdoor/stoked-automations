- **Distribution Model**: GitHub-based marketplace catalog (JSON) instead of Gumroad
- **Focus**: Community-driven growth and first-mover advantage

### Removed

- Commercial plugin packs infrastructure (`website/products/`)
- Gumroad sales integration (`website/marketing-site/`)
- Build automation for commercial distribution (`website/scripts/`)
- Internal business reports (`website/000-docs/`)

### Infrastructure

- Marketplace catalog: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with 4 plugins
- Plugin validation CI/CD pipeline
- GitHub Sponsors monetization framework
- Community contribution workflow

### Metrics

- **Production Plugins**: 1 (git-commit-smart)
- **Example Plugins**: 3 (educational)
- **Templates**: 4 (starter templates)
- **Validation Scripts**: 3 (quality assurance)
- **Documentation Pages**: 6+ (comprehensive guides)

### Migration Notes

This release represents a complete pivot from a commercial model to an open-source community marketplace. The restructure was motivated by:

1. **Distribution Reality**: Claude Code plugin marketplace doesn't support commercial sales
2. **Community Value**: Open-source model better serves developer community
3. **First-Mover Advantage**: Launched days after Anthropic's plugin announcement (October 2025)
4. **Sustainable Model**: GitHub Sponsors + consulting provides sustainable revenue

All quality work (validation systems, templates, production plugin) was preserved and migrated to the new structure.
