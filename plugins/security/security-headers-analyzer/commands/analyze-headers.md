## What It Does

1. **Header Scanning**: Analyze all HTTP response headers
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify missing security headers
3. **Configuration Review**: Check header values and policies
4. **Best Practices**: Recommend optimal header configurations
5. **Testing**: Validate header effectiveness

## Output

- Security header audit report
- Missing header recommendations
- Configuration improvement suggestions
- CSP policy generator
- Implementation code examples
