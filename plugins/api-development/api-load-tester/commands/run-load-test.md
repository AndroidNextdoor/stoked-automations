# Run API Load Test

Execute load tests with k6, Gatling, or Artillery to measure API performance under load.

## Test Types

- Load testing (sustained load)
- Stress testing (breaking point)
- Spike testing (sudden traffic)
- Soak testing (extended duration)

## Metrics

- Requests per second
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Throughput
- Concurrent users

Validate API performance at scale.
