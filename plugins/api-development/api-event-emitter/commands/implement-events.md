# Implement Event-Driven API

Build event-driven APIs with message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) and event streaming.

## Components

- Event publishers
- Event subscribers
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Event streaming (Kafka, Kinesis)
- Event schemas (Avro, Protobuf)
- Dead letter queues
- Event replay/reprocessing

## Patterns

- Event sourcing
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Saga pattern
- Event notification
- Event-carried state transfer

Build scalable event-driven architectures.
