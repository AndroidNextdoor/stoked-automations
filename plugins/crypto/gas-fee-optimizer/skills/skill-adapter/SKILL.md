name: Optimizing Gas Fees
description: |
  Analyzes Ethereum transaction costs and provides strategic recommendations for minimizing gas fees through timing optimization, Layer 2 routing, and cost-benefit analysis. Activates when users mention "gas fees," "transaction costs," "optimize gas," "ethereum expensive," "L2," "when to transact," or ask about network congestion and fee reduction strategies.

## Overview

This skill helps users minimize Ethereum transaction costs by analyzing current gas prices, identifying optimal timing windows, and recommending alternative networks. It provides real-time fee analysis, historical comparisons, and strategic routing advice across Layer 2 solutions and sidechains.

## How It Works

1. **Gas Price Analysis**: Retrieves current base fees, priority fees, and calculates total transaction costs for different operation types
2. **Timing Optimization**: Compares current fees to historical patterns and identifies low-congestion time windows
3. **Route Comparison**: Evaluates Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) and sidechains (Polygon, Gnosis) for cost savings
4. **Strategic Recommendations**: Provides wait-vs-execute advice based on urgency, savings potential, and market conditions

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks about current gas prices or transaction costs
- Mentions wanting to "optimize," "reduce," or "save on" gas fees
- Asks "when should I transact" or timing-related questions
- Compares Ethereum mainnet to Layer 2 or sidechain options
- Requests cost estimates for specific transactions (swaps, NFT mints, transfers)
- Mentions high fees or network congestion issues

## Examples

### Example 1: Transaction Timing
User request: "Should I swap my tokens now or wait for gas to be cheaper?"

The skill will:
1. Analyze current gas prices and network congestion
2. Compare to 24-hour and 7-day historical averages
3. Identify typical low-fee time windows
4. Provide wait-vs-execute recommendation with potential savings

### Example 2: Network Comparison
User request: "Compare gas costs for bridging to different L2s"

The skill will:
1. Calculate bridging costs for major Layer 2 networks
2. Compare ongoing transaction fees on each network
3. Factor in bridge time and liquidity considerations
4. Recommend optimal network based on user's transaction frequency

### Example 3: Transaction-Specific Analysis
User request: "What's the cheapest way to mint this NFT?"

The skill will:
1. Estimate gas costs for the minting transaction
2. Check if the collection supports Layer 2 minting
3. Analyze timing patterns for similar transactions
4. Provide cost breakdown and optimization strategy

## Best Practices

- **Timing Analysis**: Always provide context with historical comparisons and percentile rankings
- **Route Recommendations**: Consider both immediate costs and long-term savings for frequent users
- **Urgency Assessment**: Factor in time-sensitivity vs potential savings when making recommendations
- **Cost Transparency**: Break down all fees including base fee, priority fee, and bridge costs
- **Multiple Options**: Present several strategies (timing, routing, batching) for comprehensive optimization

## Integration

Works alongside portfolio management tools for transaction planning, DeFi plugins for protocol-specific optimizations, and market analysis tools for timing strategies. Integrates with bridge and Layer 2 plugins to provide seamless cross-chain transaction routing and cost optimization across the entire Ethereum ecosystem.
