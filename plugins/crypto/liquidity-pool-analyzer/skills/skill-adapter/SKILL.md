name: Analyzing DeFi Liquidity Pools
description: |
  Analyzes DeFi liquidity pools for impermanent loss, APY calculations, and optimization opportunities across multiple protocols like Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer. Activates when users mention "analyze pool", "impermanent loss", "LP analysis", "liquidity pool", "APY calculation", "DeFi optimization", "pool comparison", or need help with liquidity provider strategies. Provides comprehensive risk assessment, yield projections, and position optimization recommendations for maximizing returns while managing IL exposure.

## Overview

This skill enables comprehensive analysis of DeFi liquidity pools, calculating impermanent loss, APY projections, and identifying optimization opportunities. It supports major protocols including Uniswap V2/V3, Curve, Balancer, and PancakeSwap across multiple chains.

## How It Works

1. **Pool Analysis**: Retrieves real-time data on token pairs, liquidity depth, volume, and fee structures
2. **Risk Calculation**: Computes impermanent loss scenarios, volatility metrics, and protocol-specific risks
3. **Optimization**: Provides range recommendations for concentrated liquidity and rebalancing strategies
4. **Comparison**: Evaluates multiple pools side-by-side for best yield opportunities

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to "analyze a liquidity pool" or "check LP performance"
- Mentions "impermanent loss" or "IL calculation"
- Requests "APY analysis" or "yield farming comparison"
- Asks about "pool optimization" or "LP strategy"
- Needs help with "DeFi investment decisions"
- Mentions specific pools like "ETH/USDC" or protocol names

## Examples

### Example 1: Pool Performance Analysis
User request: "Analyze the ETH/USDC pool on Uniswap V3"

The skill will:
1. Fetch current pool metrics, fees, and liquidity distribution
2. Calculate historical and projected APY including base fees and rewards
3. Assess impermanent loss exposure and provide risk ratings
4. Recommend optimal price ranges for concentrated liquidity positions

### Example 2: Multi-Pool Comparison
User request: "Compare yield opportunities between Curve and Balancer stablecoin pools"

The skill will:
1. Analyze comparable pools across both protocols
2. Calculate risk-adjusted returns accounting for different mechanisms
3. Highlight protocol-specific benefits like governance tokens
4. Provide recommendations based on capital size and risk tolerance

### Example 3: Impermanent Loss Calculator
User request: "Calculate IL if ETH goes from $2000 to $3000 in my LP position"

The skill will:
1. Model the price change impact on the liquidity position
2. Calculate exact impermanent loss percentage and dollar amounts
3. Compare against holding the underlying assets
4. Suggest mitigation strategies or rebalancing opportunities

## Best Practices

- **Risk Assessment**: Always consider impermanent loss alongside yield calculations
- **Time Horizon**: Factor in gas costs and minimum position duration for profitability
- **Protocol Risks**: Evaluate smart contract risks, governance changes, and liquidity migration
- **Tax Implications**: Consider the tax treatment of LP rewards and impermanent loss

## Integration

Works seamlessly with portfolio tracking tools and DeFi dashboards. Can integrate with yield farming strategies and automated rebalancing systems for active liquidity management.
