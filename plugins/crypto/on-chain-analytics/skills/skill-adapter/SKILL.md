## Overview

This skill automatically activates the on-chain-analytics plugin to provide comprehensive blockchain metrics analysis. It monitors network health, tracks whale movements, analyzes holder distribution, and provides insights into transaction patterns and exchange flows across various blockchain networks.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers real-time blockchain data including transaction volumes, wallet activities, and network statistics
2. **Metric Analysis**: Processes whale movements, holder distributions, exchange flows, and supply metrics
3. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analytics reports with actionable insights and trend analysis

## When to Use This Skill

- When analyzing blockchain network health and performance metrics
- For tracking large wallet movements and whale activity patterns
- When investigating holder distribution and concentration analysis
- For monitoring exchange inflows/outflows and market dynamics
- When researching transaction velocity and network adoption trends
- For conducting due diligence on blockchain projects or tokens

## Examples

### Example 1: Whale Movement Analysis
User request: "Track whale movements for Bitcoin over the past week"

The skill will:
1. Activate the on-chain-analytics plugin using `/analyze-chain` command
2. Generate a report showing large wallet transactions, exchange transfers, and whale accumulation patterns

### Example 2: Network Health Assessment
User request: "Analyze Ethereum network metrics and holder distribution"

The skill will:
1. Collect network health data including hash rate, active addresses, and transaction throughput
2. Provide holder distribution analysis showing concentration levels and decentralization metrics

### Example 3: Exchange Flow Monitoring
User request: "Check exchange flows and supply distribution for this token"

The skill will:
1. Monitor exchange inflows and outflows to identify market pressure indicators
2. Analyze supply distribution across wallets and identify potential selling pressure

## Best Practices

- **Timeframe Selection**: Specify clear time periods for analysis to get more focused insights
- **Multiple Metrics**: Combine different analytics types for comprehensive market understanding
- **Context Awareness**: Consider market conditions when interpreting whale movements and exchange flows
- **Regular Monitoring**: Set up recurring analysis for ongoing projects or investments

## Integration

Works seamlessly with trading and portfolio management tools by providing fundamental blockchain data. Complements technical analysis plugins by offering on-chain confirmation of market trends. Can integrate with alert systems to notify of significant whale movements or network changes.
