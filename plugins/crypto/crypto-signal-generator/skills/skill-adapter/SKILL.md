## Overview

This skill transforms Claude Code into a cryptocurrency technical analysis engine that generates professional-grade trading signals. It analyzes multiple technical indicators, identifies chart patterns, and provides multi-timeframe confluence to deliver actionable buy/sell signals with specific entry and exit strategies.

## How It Works

1. **Market Analysis**: Processes technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, moving averages, volume analysis, and chart patterns across multiple timeframes
2. **Signal Generation**: Combines indicator readings to determine directional bias (Long/Short/Neutral) with confidence ratings from 40-95%
3. **Trading Plan Creation**: Provides specific entry prices, stop-loss levels, take-profit targets, position sizing, and risk/reward calculations
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates multi-timeframe confluence, identifies risk factors, and provides signal confirmation checklists

## When to Use This Skill

- Users ask for trading signals for specific cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Questions about whether to "long" or "short" a crypto asset
- Requests for entry and exit points or price targets
- Need for technical analysis or chart pattern identification
- Scalping, day trading, or swing trading setup requests
- Multi-asset signal comparisons or portfolio analysis
- Risk management and position sizing guidance

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Signal Request
User request: "Generate signal for BTC/USDT"

The skill will:
1. Analyze BTC across 15m, 1H, 4H, daily, and weekly timeframes
2. Provide comprehensive technical indicator table with trend/momentum/volatility assessment
3. Generate signal summary with direction, strength rating, and confidence percentage
4. Deliver complete trading plan with entries, stops, and targets

### Example 2: Scalping Setup
User request: "Give me scalping signals for SOL 15-minute chart"

The skill will:
1. Focus on short-term indicators optimized for 15m-1H timeframes
2. Identify immediate support/resistance levels and volume confirmation
3. Provide rapid-fire entry/exit strategy with tight stop-losses
4. Calculate appropriate position sizing for scalping risk profile

### Example 3: Swing Trading Analysis
User request: "What's the swing trade setup for LINK?"

The skill will:
1. Emphasize daily and weekly chart analysis with major trend identification
2. Locate key swing levels using Fibonacci retracements and major support/resistance
3. Provide wider stop-losses and multiple take-profit targets for swing timeframe
4. Include fundamental catalysts and market context affecting medium-term outlook

### Example 4: Multi-Asset Comparison
User request: "Compare signals: BTC vs ETH vs SOL"

The skill will:
1. Generate individual technical analysis for each asset
2. Rank signal strength and confidence across all three cryptocurrencies
3. Identify correlation factors and relative strength analysis
4. Recommend portfolio allocation and risk distribution strategies

## Best Practices

- **Signal Confirmation**: Always wait for multiple indicator confluence before acting on signals
- **Risk Management**: Never risk more than 1-3% of portfolio on single trade, regardless of signal strength
- **Timeframe Alignment**: Ensure trade direction aligns with higher timeframe trend for better success rates
- **Volume Validation**: Strong signals require volume confirmation - avoid low-volume breakouts
- **Market Context**: Consider overall crypto market sentiment and Bitcoin dominance impact
- **Stop-Loss Discipline**: Always set stops beyond recent swing levels, not arbitrary percentages

## Integration

Works seamlessly with portfolio management tools for position sizing calculations, connects with market data feeds for real-time analysis, and integrates with risk management systems. Can be combined with news analysis plugins to factor fundamental catalysts into technical signals, and pairs with backtesting tools to validate signal performance across historical data.
