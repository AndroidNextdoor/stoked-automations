## Overview

The Creator Studio Pack transforms Claude Code into a complete creative studio for builder-filmmakers. It automatically activates when you want to document your development process, create educational content, or turn your builds into viral videos through 20 integrated plugins.

## How It Works

1. **Build Documentation**: Auto-logs your development process, captures breakthroughs, and generates video-ready content
2. **Video Production**: Records, edits, and optimizes videos using AI-assisted tools and DaVinci Resolve integration  
3. **Content Distribution**: Automatically generates thumbnails, titles, and distributes across 8+ platforms
4. **Performance Optimization**: Tracks analytics and optimizes future content strategy

## When to Use This Skill

- Recording coding sessions or development walkthroughs
- Creating tutorial videos about your projects
- Generating thumbnails, titles, or video metadata
- Editing recorded footage automatically
- Distributing content across multiple platforms
- Documenting build processes for later video creation
- Repurposing one video into multiple content formats

## Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Document Development
User request: "Start recording while I build this React component and document the process"

The skill will:
1. Activate build-logger-agent to capture code changes and decisions
2. Start screen-recorder-command to capture visual progress
3. Mark important moments and breakthroughs automatically
4. Generate a video script from the documented build process

### Example 2: Complete Video Production
User request: "Create a YouTube video from my Redis implementation with thumbnails and subtitles"

The skill will:
1. Use code-explainer-video to generate script from your Redis code
2. Edit footage with video-editor-ai removing silence and awkward pauses
3. Generate eye-catching thumbnail with thumbnail-designer
4. Add animated subtitles using subtitle-generator-pro
5. Optimize title and metadata with title-optimizer and seo-metadata-generator

### Example 3: Content Distribution
User request: "Distribute my tutorial video across all platforms and repurpose into shorter content"

The skill will:
1. Use distribution-automator to publish to YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other platforms
2. Apply repurpose-content to create 30+ variations (shorts, threads, blog posts)
3. Generate platform-specific thumbnails and descriptions
4. Schedule releases using content-calendar-ai

## Best Practices

- **Recording Strategy**: Use batch-recording-scheduler to record multiple videos in focused sessions rather than one-off recordings
- **Content Planning**: Leverage viral-idea-generator early in your build process to identify content opportunities
- **Quality Control**: Always review AI-generated scripts and thumbnails before publishing
- **Analytics Focus**: Use analytics-insights weekly to understand what content performs best
- **Template Efficiency**: Save successful video formats in template-library for consistent branding

## Integration

Works seamlessly with DaVinci Resolve for professional video editing, FFmpeg for format conversion, and YouTube/social media APIs for automated distribution. Integrates with your existing development workflow by hooking into git commits, build processes, and IDE activities to automatically capture content-worthy moments.
