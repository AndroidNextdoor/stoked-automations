# Setup GitLab MCP Server

Guide the user through setting up the GitLab MCP server for automated Git operations and merge request management.

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

First, verify the user has the necessary tools installed:

1. **Docker** - Check if Docker is installed and running:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker ps
   ```

2. **GitLab Access** - Verify they have:
   - GitLab instance URL (gitlab.com or self-hosted)
   - GitLab account with project access
   - Permissions to create merge requests

If Docker is not installed, guide them to:
- **macOS**: `brew install --cask docker` or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install docker.io`
- **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

## Step 2: Create GitLab Personal Access Token

Guide the user to create a personal access token:

### For GitLab.com:
1. Navigate to: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
2. Click "Add new token"
3. Give it a name: "Claude Code MCP Server"
4. Set expiration date (recommended: 1 year)
5. Select scopes:
   - âœ“ **api** - Full API access
   - âœ“ **read_api** - Read API
   - âœ“ **read_repository** - Read repositories
   - âœ“ **write_repository** - Write to repositories
6. Click "Create personal access token"
7. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (shown only once!)

### For Self-Hosted GitLab:
1. Navigate to: `https://your-gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens`
2. Follow the same steps as above

**Security Note**: Store this token securely. It provides full API access to your GitLab account.

## Step 3: Determine GitLab API URL

Ask the user which GitLab instance they're using:

### GitLab.com (default):
```bash
GITLAB_API_URL="https://gitlab.com/api/v4"
```

### Self-Hosted GitLab:
```bash
GITLAB_API_URL="https://your-gitlab-instance.com/api/v4"
```

**Important**: Always include `/api/v4` at the end.

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Guide them to add these to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile`):

```bash
# GitLab MCP Server Configuration
export GITLAB_TOKEN="glpat-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Their personal access token
export GITLAB_API_URL="https://gitlab.com/api/v4"  # Or their self-hosted URL
```

After adding, have them reload their shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Verify the variables are set:
```bash
echo $GITLAB_TOKEN
echo $GITLAB_API_URL
```

## Step 5: Configure Claude Code MCP Server

Guide them to edit their Claude Code configuration file at `~/.config/claude/config.json`.

Add the GitLab MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "-e", "GITLAB_API_URL",
        "mcp/gitlab"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITLAB_TOKEN}",
        "GITLAB_API_URL": "${GITLAB_API_URL}"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

If `mcpServers` already exists (e.g., with Atlassian MCP), add the `gitlab` section alongside existing servers.

**Example with both servers:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["..."],
      "env": {"..."}
    },
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "-e", "GITLAB_API_URL",
        "mcp/gitlab"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITLAB_TOKEN}",
        "GITLAB_API_URL": "${GITLAB_API_URL}"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Pull Docker Image

Have them pre-pull the Docker image:

```bash
docker pull mcp/gitlab:latest
```

This ensures the image is ready and avoids delays during first use.

## Step 7: Test GitLab API Access

Before testing the MCP server, verify their token works with a simple API call:

```bash
curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}" \
  "${GITLAB_API_URL}/user"
```

**Expected response**: JSON with their user information (username, email, etc.)

If this fails:
- Check token is correct
- Verify API URL includes `/api/v4`
- Ensure token hasn't expired

## Step 8: Verify in Claude Code

1. Restart Claude Code completely (exit and restart)
2. Check available MCP tools:
   ```
   /mcp list
   ```

3. You should see GitLab MCP tools like:
   - `mcp__gitlab__get_project`
   - `mcp__gitlab__list_branches`
   - `mcp__gitlab__create_merge_request`
   - `mcp__gitlab__get_merge_request`
   - `mcp__gitlab__update_merge_request`

## Step 9: Test with a Real Project

Have them test with one of their actual GitLab projects:

1. Ask them for a project path (e.g., `username/repository-name`)
2. Test listing branches:
   ```
   Can you list the branches in my GitLab project username/repository-name?
   ```

3. If successful, the MCP server will fetch and display branches.

## Troubleshooting

### "Docker command not found"
- Install Docker Desktop and ensure it's running
- Verify with: `docker ps`

### "Authentication failed" or "401 Unauthorized"
- Verify token is correct and hasn't expired
- Check token has required scopes (api, read_repository, write_repository)
- Test token with curl command above

### "Cannot connect to GitLab API"
- Verify GITLAB_API_URL is correct (includes `/api/v4`)
- For self-hosted: Ensure URL is accessible
- Check firewall/VPN isn't blocking connection

### "MCP tools not appearing"
- Ensure config.json syntax is valid: `jq . ~/.config/claude/config.json`
- Restart Claude Code completely
- Check Docker container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`

### "Project not found"
- Verify project path format: `namespace/project-name`
- Check you have access to the project
- Ensure token has read permissions

### "Cannot create merge request"
- Verify token has `write_repository` scope
- Check you're a member of the project
- Ensure branch exists and differs from target

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens to git** - Always use environment variables
2. **Use minimal scopes** - Only grant necessary permissions
3. **Rotate tokens regularly** - Create new tokens every 90-180 days
4. **Store tokens securely** - Consider using a password manager
5. **Review token usage** - Check GitLab access logs periodically
6. **Revoke unused tokens** - Remove old tokens from GitLab settings

## Token Scope Reference

Required scopes for git-jira-workflow plugin:

| Scope | Purpose | Required |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `api` | Full API access | âœ“ Yes |
| `read_api` | Read API endpoints | âœ“ Yes |
| `read_repository` | Read repository data | âœ“ Yes |
| `write_repository` | Create branches, push code | âœ“ Yes |

Optional scopes (if using additional features):
- `read_user` - Read user profile
- `write_webhook` - Create webhooks (future feature)

## Next Steps

Once the GitLab MCP server is configured:

1. If not done yet, set up Atlassian MCP: `/setup-atlassian-mcp`
2. Test both servers together: `/test-mcp-servers`
3. Start using the workflow: Try "Create a merge request for JIRA-1234"

## Configuration Summary

After successful setup, you should have:

âœ“ Docker installed and running
âœ“ GitLab personal access token created
âœ“ Environment variables set in shell profile
âœ“ Claude Code config.json configured
âœ“ GitLab MCP Docker image pulled
âœ“ MCP tools visible in `/mcp list`
âœ“ Token tested with real GitLab API

The GitLab MCP server is now ready to use with the git-jira-workflow plugin! ðŸŽ‰

## Common Use Cases

Once configured, you can use natural language commands like:

**List branches:**
```
Show me all branches in my project
```

**Create merge request:**
```
Create a merge request from JIRA-1234-feature-branch to main
```

**Get MR status:**
```
What's the status of merge request #42?
```

**Update MR:**
```
Update the description of MR #42 to include the test results
```

All these operations will use the GitLab MCP server automatically!
