# Setup Atlassian MCP Server

Guide the user through setting up the Atlassian MCP server for Jira integration with this workflow plugin.

## Step 1: Check Prerequisites

First, verify the user has the necessary tools installed:

1. **Docker** - Check if Docker is installed and running:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker ps
   ```

2. **Jira Access** - Verify they have:
   - Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://company.atlassian.net`)
   - Jira account email
   - Admin or appropriate permissions to create API tokens

If Docker is not installed, guide them to:
- **macOS**: `brew install --cask docker` or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install docker.io` or distribution-specific package manager
- **Windows**: Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

## Step 2: Create Atlassian API Token

Guide the user to create an API token:

1. Navigate to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Give it a name like "Claude Code MCP Server"
4. Copy the token (it will only be shown once!)

**Important**: Store this token securely. They'll need it for the environment variables.

## Step 3: Gather Required Information

Ask the user to provide:

1. **JIRA_URL**: Their Jira instance URL
   - Example: `https://company.atlassian.net`
   - Don't include `/browse/` or project paths

2. **JIRA_USERNAME** (their Atlassian email):
   - Example: `user@company.com`

3. **JIRA_API_TOKEN**: The token they just created
   - This will be stored as `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN` environment variable

## Step 4: Set Environment Variables

Guide them to add these to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile`):

```bash
# Atlassian MCP Server Configuration
export JIRA_URL="https://their-company.atlassian.net"
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL="their-email@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="their-api-token-here"
export CONFLUENCE_URL="https://their-company.atlassian.net/wiki"  # Optional
```

After adding, have them reload their shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

Verify the variables are set:
```bash
echo $JIRA_URL
echo $ATLASSIAN_EMAIL
echo $ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN
```

## Step 5: Configure Claude Code MCP Server

Guide them to edit their Claude Code configuration file at `~/.config/claude/config.json`.

If the file doesn't exist, create it with this structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-atlassian": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "JIRA_URL",
        "-e", "JIRA_USERNAME",
        "-e", "JIRA_API_TOKEN",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_URL",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME",
        "-e", "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN",
        "ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "${ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN}",
        "JIRA_URL": "${JIRA_URL}",
        "JIRA_USERNAME": "${ATLASSIAN_EMAIL}",
        "CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN": "${ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN}",
        "CONFLUENCE_URL": "${CONFLUENCE_URL}",
        "CONFLUENCE_USERNAME": "${ATLASSIAN_EMAIL}"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

If `mcpServers` already exists, add the `mcp-atlassian` section to it.

## Step 6: Pull Docker Image

Have them pre-pull the Docker image to avoid delays during first use:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest
```

This may take a few minutes depending on their internet connection.

## Step 7: Test the Connection

Run the test command to verify the MCP server is working:

```bash
# This will be tested in the next step via Claude Code
/test-mcp-servers
```

Or manually test with Docker:

```bash
docker run -i --rm \
  -e JIRA_URL="${JIRA_URL}" \
  -e JIRA_USERNAME="${ATLASSIAN_EMAIL}" \
  -e JIRA_API_TOKEN="${ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN}" \
  ghcr.io/sooperset/mcp-atlassian:latest
```

## Step 8: Verify in Claude Code

1. Restart Claude Code completely (exit and restart)
2. Check available MCP tools:
   ```
   /mcp list
   ```

3. You should see Atlassian MCP tools like:
   - `mcp__atlassian__getIssue`
   - `mcp__atlassian__createIssue`
   - `mcp__atlassian__updateIssue`
   - `mcp__atlassian__addComment`
   - `mcp__atlassian__searchIssues`

## Troubleshooting

### "Docker command not found"
- Install Docker Desktop and ensure it's running
- Verify with: `docker ps`

### "Authentication failed"
- Verify your API token is correct
- Check your email matches your Atlassian account
- Ensure the token has proper permissions

### "Cannot connect to Jira"
- Verify your JIRA_URL is correct (no trailing slash)
- Check you're using the correct Atlassian instance
- Test access in browser: `${JIRA_URL}/rest/api/2/myself`

### "MCP tools not appearing"
- Ensure config.json syntax is valid (use `jq . ~/.config/claude/config.json`)
- Restart Claude Code completely
- Check Docker container logs: `docker ps` then `docker logs <container-id>`

### "Permission denied errors"
- Verify your Jira account has permissions to create/update issues
- Check the API token hasn't expired
- Ensure you're using the correct project key

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit tokens to git** - Always use environment variables
2. **Rotate tokens regularly** - Create new tokens every 90 days
3. **Use minimal permissions** - Only grant necessary Jira permissions
4. **Store tokens securely** - Consider using a password manager
5. **Review access logs** - Check Atlassian security logs periodically

## Next Steps

Once the Atlassian MCP server is configured:

1. Set up GitLab MCP server: `/setup-gitlab-mcp`
2. Test both servers: `/test-mcp-servers`
3. Start using the workflow: Try "Start working on JIRA-1234"

## Configuration Summary

After successful setup, you should have:

âœ“ Docker installed and running
âœ“ Atlassian API token created
âœ“ Environment variables set in shell profile
âœ“ Claude Code config.json configured
âœ“ Atlassian MCP Docker image pulled
âœ“ MCP tools visible in `/mcp list`

The Atlassian MCP server is now ready to use with the git-jira-workflow plugin! ðŸŽ‰
