## Test Data Expertise

### Finding Relevant Test Data

I can help find and generate realistic test data for insurance testing:

**Property Data:**
```sql
-- Find test properties with specific characteristics
SELECT
    property_id,
    address,
    city,
    state,
    zip_code,
    construction_type,
    year_built,
    square_feet,
    protection_class,
    territory_code
FROM test_properties
WHERE
    state = 'FL'  -- Hurricane exposure
    AND construction_type = 'FRAME'  -- Wood frame
    AND year_built < 1980  -- Older construction
    AND protection_class >= 5  -- Higher risk
    AND distance_to_coast < 1  -- Coastal property
LIMIT 10
```

**Auto Insurance Test Data:**
```sql
-- Find test vehicles with high-risk profiles
SELECT
    vin,
    make,
    model,
    year,
    driver_age,
    driver_gender,
    credit_score,
    prior_claims,
    violations
FROM test_vehicles
WHERE
    driver_age < 25  -- Young driver
    AND credit_score < 600  -- Poor credit
    AND prior_claims > 0  -- Claims history
    AND violations > 0  -- Moving violations
ORDER BY
    (prior_claims + violations) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Multi-State Test Coverage:**
```sql
-- Ensure test coverage across all regions
SELECT
    state,
    COUNT(*) as test_count,
    AVG(premium) as avg_premium,
    MIN(premium) as min_premium,
    MAX(premium) as max_premium
FROM test_quotes
WHERE
    test_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
GROUP BY state
HAVING test_count < 5  -- Identify states with low test coverage
ORDER BY test_count ASC
```

**Edge Cases and Boundary Testing:**
```sql
-- Find properties at rating boundaries
SELECT *
FROM test_properties
WHERE
    -- Just below/above key thresholds
    square_feet IN (999, 1000, 1001)  -- 1000 sq ft threshold
    OR year_built IN (1979, 1980, 1981)  -- Pre-1980 surcharge
    OR protection_class IN (4, 5, 6)  -- Protection class boundary
    OR dwelling_limit IN (249000, 250000, 251000)  -- $250k threshold
```

### Realistic Test Scenarios

**Scenario: Florida Coastal Property**
```groovy
def testData = [
    // Property characteristics
    address: '123 Ocean Drive',
    city: 'Miami Beach',
    state: 'FL',
    zipCode: '33139',
    constructionType: 'MASONRY',
    yearBuilt: 1995,
    squareFeet: 2500,
    dwellingLimit: 450000,

    // Florida-specific requirements
    windMitigation: true,  // Hurricane shutters
    roofShape: 'HIP',      // Wind-resistant
    roofCovering: 'CONCRETE_TILE',
    openingProtection: 'HURRICANE_SHUTTERS',

    // Expected results
    expectedWindDeductible: '5%',  // Hurricane deductible
    expectedExclusions: ['FLOOD'],  // Requires separate NFIP policy
    expectedPremium: 3200,  // High due to coastal exposure

    // Validation points
    assertions: [
        'Wind deductible is separate from AOP deductible',
        'Flood exclusion is present',
        'Wind mitigation credits applied',
        'Premium within expected range (Â±10%)'
    ]
]
```

**Scenario: Multi-State Quote Comparison**
```groovy
def states = ['CA', 'TX', 'FL', 'NY', 'IL']

states.each { state ->
    def testData = [
        // Same property in different states
        squareFeet: 2000,
        yearBuilt: 2010,
        constructionType: 'FRAME',
        dwellingLimit: 300000,

        // State-specific
        state: state,

        // Expected differences
        expectedFactors: getStateRatingFactors(state),
        expectedMandatoryCoverages: getMandatoryCoverages(state),
        expectedTaxes: getStateTaxRate(state)
    ]

    // Test quote generation for this state
    testQuoteGeneration(testData)
}
```

## Insurance-Specific Test Cases

### Premium Calculation Validation

```groovy
/**
 * Test Case: Validate Inland Marine Rating Worksheet
 *
 * Purpose: Verify rating algorithm produces correct premium for
 *          inland marine coverage (equipment, tools, contractors)
 *
 * Insurance Domain Context:
 * - Inland marine covers movable property and equipment
 * - Rating based on equipment type, value, territory, deductible
 * - State-specific rate filings and forms
 * - ISO forms vs. proprietary forms
 */

def testData = [
    // Equipment details
    equipmentType: 'CONTRACTORS_EQUIPMENT',
    scheduleItems: [
        [description: 'Excavator', value: 75000],
        [description: 'Dump Truck', value: 45000],
        [description: 'Tools', value: 15000]
    ],
    totalValue: 135000,

    // Coverage details
    deductible: 1000,
    territory: 'MIDWEST',
    state: 'IL',

    // Rating factors (from ISO or company manual)
    baseRate: 0.35,  // Per $100 of value
    territoryFactor: 1.05,
    deductibleCredit: 0.90,  // 10% credit for $1000 deductible

    // Expected premium calculation
    expectedBasePremium: 135000 / 100 * 0.35,  // $472.50
    expectedWithTerritory: 472.50 * 1.05,      // $496.13
    expectedWithDeductible: 496.13 * 0.90,     // $446.52
    expectedFinalPremium: 446.52,  // Round to $447

    // Assertions
    assertions: [
        'Base premium calculated correctly',
        'Territory factor applied',
        'Deductible credit applied',
        'Premium rounded to nearest dollar',
        'Within ISO approved rate range',
        'Matches manual rating worksheet'
    ]
]

// Execute test
WebUI.comment("Testing inland marine rating for ${testData.state}")
navigateToInlandMarineQuote()
enterEquipmentSchedule(testData.scheduleItems)
selectTerritory(testData.territory)
selectDeductible(testData.deductible)
clickGenerateQuote()

// Validate calculations
def actualPremium = getCalculatedPremium()
def tolerance = 1.0  // $1 tolerance for rounding

assert Math.abs(actualPremium - testData.expectedFinalPremium) <= tolerance :
    "Premium mismatch: Expected ${testData.expectedFinalPremium}, got ${actualPremium}"

// Verify rating worksheet details
def worksheet = downloadRatingWorksheet()
assert worksheet.contains("Base Rate: ${testData.baseRate}") :
    "Base rate not shown on worksheet"
assert worksheet.contains("Territory Factor: ${testData.territoryFactor}") :
    "Territory factor not shown on worksheet"
```

### State-Specific Validation

```groovy
/**
 * Test Case: Florida Hurricane Deductible
 *
 * Insurance Domain Context:
 * - Florida requires separate hurricane deductible
 * - Can be percentage (2%, 5%, 10%) or flat dollar amount
 * - Applies to named storm losses
 * - Must be disclosed prominently
 */

def testData = [
    state: 'FL',
    dwellingLimit: 400000,
    hurricaneDeductible: '5%',  // 5% of dwelling limit
    expectedDeductibleAmount: 20000,  // $400k * 5%

    assertions: [
        'Hurricane deductible shown separately from AOP deductible',
        'Dollar amount calculated correctly ($20,000)',
        'Disclosure statement present on quote',
        'Named storm definition included',
        'Deductible applied to dwelling limit, not total insured value'
    ]
]
```

### Regulatory Compliance Validation

```groovy
/**
 * Test Case: California Proposition 103 Compliance
 *
 * Insurance Domain Context:
 * - California Prop 103 requires specific rating factors
 * - Driving record must be weighted > 20%
 * - Years licensed must be weighted > 20%
 * - Annual miles must be weighted > 20%
 * - Credit cannot be primary factor
 * - All rate changes require DOI approval
 */

def testData = [
    state: 'CA',
    drivingRecord: 'CLEAN',  // No violations
    yearsLicensed: 15,
    annualMiles: 12000,
    creditScore: 650,  // Should have minimal impact

    assertions: [
        'Driving record factor applied and documented',
        'Years licensed factor applied and documented',
        'Annual miles factor applied and documented',
        'Credit score has limited impact',
        'Combined weight of Prop 103 factors > 60%',
        'Rate filing number displayed',
        'Complies with DOI approved algorithm'
    ]
]
```

## Financial Calculations

### Premium Financing

```groovy
/**
 * Test Case: Premium Financing Calculation
 *
 * Financial Domain Context:
 * - Down payment (typically 20-25%)
 * - Remaining balance financed at interest rate
 * - Monthly installments calculated
 * - Finance charges disclosed
 */

def testData = [
    totalPremium: 1200.00,
    downPaymentPercent: 0.25,  // 25%
    downPayment: 300.00,
    financedAmount: 900.00,
    annualInterestRate: 0.18,  // 18% APR
    numberOfPayments: 9,  // 9 monthly payments

    // Calculate monthly payment
    // P = A * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
    // P = 900 * [0.015(1.015)^9] / [(1.015)^9 - 1]
    monthlyRate: 0.015,  // 18% / 12
    expectedMonthlyPayment: 106.43,
    expectedTotalFinanceCharges: 57.87,

    assertions: [
        'Down payment calculated correctly',
        'Monthly payment within $0.50 tolerance',
        'Total finance charges disclosed',
        'APR disclosed (Truth in Lending)',
        'Payment schedule generated',
        'Cancellation terms disclosed'
    ]
]
```

### Loss Ratio Analysis

```groovy
/**
 * Test Case: Validate Loss Ratio Calculation
 *
 * Actuarial Domain Context:
 * - Loss Ratio = Incurred Losses / Earned Premium
 * - Combined Ratio = Loss Ratio + Expense Ratio
 * - Target combined ratio typically 95-100%
 * - Used for rate adequacy analysis
 */

def testData = [
    earnedPremium: 1000000,
    incurredLosses: 650000,
    lossAdjustmentExpenses: 50000,

    expectedLossRatio: 0.65,  // 65%
    expectedLAERatio: 0.05,   // 5%
    expenseRatio: 0.30,       // 30% (company expenses)
    expectedCombinedRatio: 1.00,  // 100%

    assertions: [
        'Loss ratio = 65% (within acceptable range)',
        'Combined ratio = 100% (at target)',
        'Profitable at current pricing',
        'No rate increase needed'
    ]
]
```

## How I Help with Insurance Testing

### 1. Domain-Aware Test Design

When you say: *"Test the inland marine rating worksheet"*

I understand:
- This involves scheduled equipment coverage
- Rating is based on equipment value, type, and territory
- State-specific forms and rate filings apply
- Need to validate rating factors and premium calculation
- Should verify against ISO manual or proprietary rating algorithm

### 2. Realistic Test Data

I can generate test data that reflects:
- Actual insurance scenarios (not generic test data)
- State-specific requirements
- Edge cases that matter in insurance (coverage limits, deductibles, thresholds)
- Regulatory boundaries

### 3. Financial Validation

I understand complex insurance calculations:
- Premium calculations with multiple rating factors
- Pro-rata cancellations and short-rate penalties
- Coinsurance penalties
- Replacement cost vs. actual cash value
- Premium financing with APR disclosure

### 4. Regulatory Compliance

I know what to test for compliance:
- State-mandated coverages
- Disclosure requirements
- Rate filing compliance
- Fair pricing regulations
- Consumer protection laws

### 5. Multi-State Testing

I can help test across all 50 states:
- Identify state-specific variations
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Validate territory codes and rates
- Test state-specific forms

## Example: Complete Insurance Test Suite

**Request:** *"Create a test suite for homeowners insurance quotes across high-risk states"*

**I will create:**

```
