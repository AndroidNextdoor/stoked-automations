## üì¶ Installation

```bash
/plugin install katalon-test-expert@stoked-automations
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Craft a Test Case

```
/craft-test-case "Login with Valid Credentials"
```

I'll create a complete, well-structured test case with comprehensive assertions, database verification, and detailed logging.

### Analyze a Test Failure

```
python3 scripts/katalon-report-parser.py resources/401ErrorReportDir
```

Provides root cause analysis, network debugging, session recording links, and fix recommendations.

### Generate Reports

```
/publish-test-report resources/401ErrorReportDir --type email --send-to qa-team@company.com
```

Creates professional HTML emails with charts, metrics, and trend indicators.

### Create JIRA Ticket

```
/create-jira-ticket resources/401ErrorReportDir
```

Automatically classifies as BUG (application issues) or TASK (test updates).

## üè¶ Insurance Domain Expertise

I understand:
- **All 50 US states** with state-specific regulations
- **Insurance products** (property, auto, liability, specialty)
- **Rating algorithms** and premium calculations
- **Financial concepts** (loss ratios, actuarial calculations)
- **Regulatory compliance** (state mandates, Prop 103, etc.)

Example test scenario:
```groovy
// Florida coastal property with hurricane coverage
def testData = [
    state: 'FL',
    address: '123 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach',
    dwellingLimit: 450000,
    hurricaneDeductible: '5%',  // Florida-specific
    windMitigation: true,
    expectedPremium: 3200
]
```

## üìö Available Commands

- `/process-webhook` - **NEW!** Process Teams webhook with S3 test results
- `/craft-test-case` - Create expert test cases with data-driven logic
- `/analyze-test` - Deep dive into test failures (via scripts)
- `/create-jira-ticket` - Automated ticket creation with classification
- `/scrape-session` - Extract LogRocket/Device Farm session data
- `/publish-test-report` - Generate HTML/Confluence/PDF reports

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+ with haralyzer
- MySQL client
- Firecrawl MCP (for session scraping)
- Atlassian MCP (for JIRA integration)
- Microsoft Teams webhook (optional, for automatic notifications)

## üîó Teams Webhook Integration

This plugin receives webhook notifications from Microsoft Teams containing signed S3 URLs to Katalon test results, then automatically downloads and analyzes them.

### How It Works

1. **Teams sends webhook** ‚Üí Test results are uploaded to S3, Teams sends notification with signed URL
2. **Claude Code receives payload** ‚Üí You use `/process-webhook` command with the JSON payload
3. **Auto-download from S3** ‚Üí Script downloads the test results archive
4. **Extract and analyze** ‚Üí Automatically parses Katalon reports and identifies failures
5. **Present insights** ‚Üí Shows test summary, failures, and actionable recommendations

### Setup

No configuration required! Just receive the webhook payload from Teams and process it.

### Usage

When you receive a Teams notification about test results:

```bash
# Copy the JSON payload from Teams and run:
/process-webhook '{"s3_url": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test-results.zip?signature=..."}'
```

### Webhook Payload Format

Your Teams webhook should send JSON with a signed S3 URL:

```json
{
  "s3_url": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/test-results.zip?AWSAccessKeyId=...&Signature=...",
  "testSuite": "Regression Suite",
  "environment": "Production",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T10:30:00Z",
  "buildId": "BUILD-12345"
}
```

The plugin supports multiple JSON structures - it will automatically find the S3 URL regardless of nesting.

### What Gets Processed

After downloading from S3, the plugin:
- ‚úÖ **Extracts archives** - Handles ZIP and TAR.GZ files
- üìä **Parses Katalon reports** - Reads execution.properties, JUnit XML, CSV reports
- üîç **Analyzes failures** - Extracts error messages, stack traces, HAR files
- üì∏ **Locates screenshots** - Finds failure screenshots and videos
- üé• **Links session recordings** - Identifies LogRocket and AWS Device Farm URLs
- üè∑Ô∏è **Classifies issues** - Determines if failures are BUGs or TASKs

### Automatic Hook

After processing completes, a post-webhook analysis hook automatically:
- Counts failed tests and errors
- Identifies available HAR files for network analysis
- Locates screenshots for visual debugging
- Detects session recording links

### Example Workflow

```
User: I just got a Teams notification about test failures

Claude: Please paste the webhook payload from Teams

User: {"s3_url": "https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/results.zip?..."}

Claude: Processing webhook...
[Downloading from S3...]
‚úÖ Downloaded 15.3 MB
[Extracting archive...]
‚úÖ Extracted 247 files
[Analyzing results...]

üìä Test Results Summary:
- Total: 45 tests
- Passed: 42 ‚úÖ
- Failed: 3 ‚ùå
- Duration: 8m 32s

‚ùå Failed Tests:
1. TC_Login_InvalidCredentials - Element not found
2. TC_Quote_PremiumCalculation - Assertion failed (expected 3200, got 3245)
3. TC_API_GetQuoteData - HTTP 401 Unauthorized

Would you like me to:
1. Create JIRA tickets for these failures?
2. Analyze HAR files for network issues?
3. Generate an HTML report?
```

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Keep test steps small** - Each step does ONE thing
2. **Use database for test data** - Central source of truth
3. **Generate reports automatically** - After every test run
4. **Add assertions everywhere** - Verify at each step
5. **Log results to database** - Track trends over time
6. **Enable Teams notifications** - Get instant alerts on test failures
