## What Are Agent Skills?

**Agent Skills are model-invoked capabilities** that Claude automatically uses when relevant to your request. Unlike slash commands (which you explicitly type), skills activate automatically based on conversation context.

**Think of it like this:**
- **Slash Command**: You say "/format-code" ‚Üí Claude formats code
- **Agent Skill**: You say "this code is messy" ‚Üí Claude automatically uses code formatter skill

Skills make Claude **smarter and more context-aware** without requiring you to remember specific commands.

- Complexity, code smells, maintainability

**What it does:**
- Scans for high complexity hotspots
- Detects code smells (long methods, deep nesting, duplicates)
- Identifies anti-patterns
- Provides prioritized, actionable recommendations

**Example:** "Can you review the code quality in src/api/?"

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Test Generator

**Activates when you mention:**
- Generate tests, write tests
- Test coverage, unit tests
- Integration tests, test cases

**What it does:**
- Creates unit and integration tests
- Includes happy path + edge cases
- Generates mock configurations
- Supports Jest, pytest, JUnit, RSpec, and more

**Example:** "Generate tests for the UserService class"

---

### 3. üìù Documentation Writer

**Example:** "Check this code for security issues"

---

### 5. ‚ö° Performance Optimizer
**Automatically identifies and fixes performance bottlenecks**

**Activates when you mention:**
- Performance, optimize, slow code
- Speed up, bottleneck
- Memory leak, improve performance

**What it does:**
- Identifies algorithm complexity issues (O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n))
- Detects memory leaks
- Finds N+1 query problems
- Provides optimized code with benchmarks

**Example:** "This function is slow, can you optimize it?"

---

## Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins

# Install Skills Powerkit
/plugin install skills-powerkit@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

**That's it!** All 5 skills are now active and will automatically invoke when relevant.

---

## How to Use

**You don't need to do anything special** - just talk naturally!

### Example Conversations

**Conversation 1: Code Review**
```
You: "I need to review the authentication code for security issues and code quality"

Claude automatically:
1. Recognizes "security issues" ‚Üí Invokes Security Scanner
2. Recognizes "code quality" ‚Üí Invokes Code Quality Analyzer
3. Scans authentication code with both skills
4. Reports security vulnerabilities + quality issues
5. Provides fixes and recommendations
```

**Conversation 2: New Feature**
```
You: "I added a payment processing function, need tests and docs"

Claude automatically:
1. Recognizes "need tests" ‚Üí Invokes Test Generator
2. Recognizes "docs" ‚Üí Invokes Documentation Writer
3. Generates comprehensive test suite
4. Creates API documentation
5. Delivers both without you asking twice
```

**Conversation 3: Performance Issue**
```
You: "The search endpoint is slow, optimize it"

Claude automatically:
1. Recognizes "slow, optimize" ‚Üí Invokes Performance Optimizer
2. Analyzes search endpoint code
3. Identifies bottlenecks (probably N+1 queries)
4. Provides optimized version with benchmarks
```

## Skills vs Commands

| Feature | Skills (This Plugin) | Slash Commands |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Invocation** | Automatic (Claude decides) | Manual (you type `/command`) |
| **Trigger** | Keywords in conversation | Explicit `/command` |
| **Intelligence** | Context-aware | Single-purpose |
| **User Experience** | Natural conversation | Command-driven |
| **Example** | "check security" ‚Üí auto-scans | `/security-scan` ‚Üí scans |

**Skills feel more natural** - like talking to an expert who knows when to use their capabilities.

### Skill Restrictions

All skills use **read-only or minimal write access** for safety:

| Skill | Allowed Tools |
|-------|--------------|
| Code Quality Analyzer | Read, Grep (read-only) |
| Test Generator | Read, Write, Grep |
| Documentation Writer | Read, Write, Grep |
| Security Scanner | Read, Grep (read-only) |
| Performance Optimizer | Read, Grep (read-only) |

**Safe for production use** - no destructive operations!
